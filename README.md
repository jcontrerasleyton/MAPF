## Multi-Agent Path Finding Algorithms

### A compilation of three MAPF algorithms:

* Windowed Hierarchical Cooperative A* (WHCA*) (D.Silver, 2006).
* improved Windowed Hierarchical Cooperative A* (iWHCA*).
* Windowed Conflict Based Search (WCBS), new algorithm by Jean Contreras.


### Explanation:

* iWHCA* is an improvement to WHCA* in the choice of partial routes.
* WCBS is a modification of Conflict Based Search algorithm (CBS) (G.Sharon, et al. 2015) based on the dynamic windows of WHCA*.


### How to use:

* Go to Algorithms/ and select any of the algortihms.
* Execute the main.sh shell scrip (use the README file for more information).


### Requirements:

* Boost: https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html
